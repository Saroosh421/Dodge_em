# Dodge_em

My first game project (aka dodge em) developed using c++ fundamentals.

//How to run this game
In order to run this game, just install openGL libraries i.e. Glew Glut on Linux i.e. ubuntu.
Before installing, open terminal on prject directory and type, "sudo apt-get update"
To install libraries, type, "sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew1.6-dev libfreeimage-dev"
In order to compile all files type, g++ -o game CImg.h util.h util.cpp game.cpp
Type "make" and then type "./game" 

//Gameplay
A window will pop up, just click on "Start Game" to play it.
Use keyboard arrow keys to move your car.
Collect all gift packets while dodgeing the enemy car and you'll be promoted to next level.
There are four levels; leveling up increases difficulty level.
